# C++ Physics Engine

A simple 2D physics engine built with **C++** and **modern OpenGL**.

---

## ðŸš€ Build and Run Options

You can run the project in two ways:

1. **Using Docker (Recommended):** Clean, self-contained, works on any machine without manual library setup.  
2. **Natively:** Using a bash script with your own compiler and libraries.

---

## ðŸŒ¿ Branches

- **`main`** â†’ Clean code base (basic windowing and rendering, no ball simulation).  
- **`Add/Delete-balls`** â†’ Development branch with full interactive simulation (add and delete balls).  

ðŸ‘‰ For the full experience, use the **`Add/Delete-balls`** branch.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/physics-engine.git
cd physics-engine
git switch Add/Delete-balls
```
